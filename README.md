## Installation

It's recommended that you install Bleda with the `gridsome create` command, so that Gridsome removes the `.git` folder and installs NPM dependencies for you:

```sh
gridsome create my-website https://github.com/cossssmin/gridsome-starter-bleda.git
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and set it up manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cossssmin/gridsome-starter-bleda.git my-website

# navigate to the directory
cd my-website

# remove the Git folder
rm -rf .git

# install NPM dependencies
npm install
```
